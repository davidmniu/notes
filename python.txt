List Comprehensions:
	allows sequences to be build from other sequences:
		squared_ints = [ e**2 for e in a_list if type(e) == types.IntType ]
	In general, we have
		[ "output expression" for "variable" in "input sequence" "optional predicate"]

String Manipulation:
	format()
		add curly brackets as placeholders
		price = 49
		txt = "The price is {} dollars"
		print(txt.format(price))

Simultaneous Assignment:
	var_name1, var_name2 = value1, value2

Argument Assignment:
	Very silly, but if there are default arguments, you can select values for specific arguments
		by referring to their names: for example, hist(bins=50, figsize=(20,15))
